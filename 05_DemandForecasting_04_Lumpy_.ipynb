        "Based on the stability of the validation loss and the low values for both the training and validation loss, **the model appears to possibly be usable for forecasting**. The fact that the validation loss is consistent and not increasing suggests that **the model is generalizing well to unseen data**, which is a good indicator of its usability.\n",
        "- With such a small dataset, the LSTM model might have `limited capacity to learn complex patterns`, which is why the losses have stabilized early.\n",
