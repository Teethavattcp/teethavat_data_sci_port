## Simulation case in Simio Shelving Shop
* Simulated the Simio Shelving Shop activities via Simio program to **evaluate the current material requirement planning (MRP) policy**.
* **Optimized simulation model** by adjusting the reorder point and order up to level based on the buffer zone in demand-driven material requirement planning (DDMRP) policy.
* Utilized Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to **rate KPI importance** and **select the optimal solution** based on weighted scores.
* Achieved significant **improvements** in KPIs: reduced unmet demand by 59.32%, cut stockouts by 28.57%, and boosted throughput by 23.68%.
