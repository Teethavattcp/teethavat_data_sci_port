## Simulation case in Simio Shelving Shop
* Simulated the Simio Shelving Shop activities via Simio program to evaluate current material requirement planning (MRP) policy.
* Optimized simulation model by adjusting the reorder point and order up to level based on the buffer zone in demand-driven material requirement planning (DDMRP) policy.
* Utilized Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to rate KPI importance and select the optimal solution based on weighted scores.
* Achieved significant improvements in KPIs: reduced unmet demand by 59.32%, cut stockouts by 28.57%, and boosted throughput by 23.68%.
